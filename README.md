Friday Timeline:

## Features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Authentication so members can create an account and view the site.
* Ability for users to join and register for leagues/teams/bonspiels/etc.
* Advanced CSS styling - including responsive design and animations

## Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources needed to create MVP:
* React to create components, Redux to manage any state.
* App will be built using Node.js framework with webpack for bundling.
* @keyframes in CSS to handle animations.
* Authentication (using Firebase?)

## Stretch goals to add to project:

* A calendar where members can reserve practice ice time using a calendar interface
* A directory of all club members with contact information.
* A database of game results that members can log. A possible API might need to be built for this.
* A notification on the website when a livestream on youtube is currently being broadcasted.
