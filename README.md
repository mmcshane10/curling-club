# _Evergreen Curling Club Website Redesign_

#### _Remaking Evergreen Curling Club's Website; 20-December-2019_

#### By _**Mike McShane**_

## Description

Capstone project during Epicodus schooling. I've remade the website for Evergreen Curling Club, the only dedicated curling facility in the state of Oregon. Users to the site can create accounts with the club, register for different events, and learn more about the club itself.

## Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, etc.
* React to create components, Redux to manage state.
* App is built using Node.js framework with webpack for bundling.
* SportsRadar Curling API is being used to pull daily results from professional games and tournaments.
* @keyframes in CSS to handle animations.
* Authentication and Data management is handled using Firebase and Firestore.

## Stretch goals to add to project:

* A calendar where members can reserve practice ice time using a calendar interface
* A directory of all club members with contact information.
* A database of game results that members can log. A possible API might need to be built for this.

## Setup/Installation Requirements_

* _Clone this repository from https://github.com/mmcshane10/curling-club.git
* _From the project's root directory, run "npm i" in the terminal._
* _From the project's root directory, run "npm run start" in the terminal._
*_Open the aplication from the localhost URL._
