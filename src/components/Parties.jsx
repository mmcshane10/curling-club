      <p>The great Olympic sport of curling appeals to people of all ages and physical abilities and lets men and women compete equally. Curling encourages strategy, leadership, team communication, problem solving, sportsmanship, socialization and competition. Curling provides a fun, unique and memorable experience. Itâ€™s a day where everyone interacts and works together as a team toward a shared goal. Whether your event is corporate team building, school field trip, private learn-to-curl, or just a mess of people who want ice time, we can get you curling.</p>
      <h5>At your event...</h5>
      <li>Your curling event will begin with a brief off-ice introduction, safety talk, and stretch.</li>
      <li>Next you will move to the ice for instruction in the basics of delivery, sweeping and skipping. Then play a game for the rest of your event.</li>
      <li>No experience necessary.  Curling is an accessible sport.</li>
